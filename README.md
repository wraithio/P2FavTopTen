Assignment : Favorite Top 10 Website

This assignment asks us to make a multi-page website that talks about your favorite items in a top ten style. This will be a group assignment, 2 per group. Each person will pick a topic and make a top 10 of it. Aaron decided to do his on his top 10 Video Games while Brock decided to do his on his top 10 anime.

> Comment: Website looks fantastic and resembles the attached Figma; Respectable Top 10 Lists; might just be my computer, but the site does not adjust when I put it on the Ipad Mini Dimensions (Remember that Medium Dimensions is '768px'); Besides that, the website functions looks amazing.
