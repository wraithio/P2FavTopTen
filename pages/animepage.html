                Starting off the honorable mentions list is Vinland Saga. It is
                about young man named Thorfinn who finds himself trying to take
                revenge against a man who killed his father when he was a young
                lad. He grows up on the man's ship learning how to fight,
                pillage, and kill, all while trying to kill him. I love this
                anime for its ability to bring conflicting characters into a war
                and shows us that no one is ever truely good or evil on the
                battlefield. Thorfinn is also so focused on revenge, and fails
                to see that the man who kills his father is the only reason that
                he himself is still alive. If you love vikings, action, and
                character development. This anime is for you!

                Next on my honorable mentions list is a new anime to the scene
                in Hell's Paradise. It is only one season long but the first
                episode is one of the best pilot episodes I have ever watching.
                Here we follow Gabimaru, a ruthless killer who has been
                captured. Instead of execution, him and others like him are
                tasked with going upon a mysterious island that has killed all
                those who have set foot there. Guards are tasked with escorting
                these killers onto the island to find a specific treasure that
                the ruler wants. However, both parties soon realize that this
                island is far more dangerous than they realized. Supernatural
                stuff starts happening around them and it becomes a fight for
                survival where both parties need to work together. This anime
                exceeded my expectiations when watching it and I am looking
                forward to season two and maybe moving it into my top 10.

                My final honorable mention has to go to Arcane. Now if this was
                top 10 animated shows this might be 1 or 2 because it is so well
                written and the animation, characters, and soundtrack are the
                epitemy of perfection. However, this is technically not an anime
                so I could not put this on my top 10 list for that reason.
                Arcane is based off the game Leauge of Legends and follows the
                relationship between two sisters Vi and Powder. In the beginning
                of the show, a man named Vandar takes them in and raises them as
                his own. Everything starts to change when Vi and her group steal
                from the upper city of Piltover and cause an explosion, leading
                to an all out manhunt in the underground. This series follows
                the depths of betrayal, civil war, and how some bonds can make
                or break an individual's mind. This is a must watch!

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                Starting off my top 10 is Hunter x Hunter. This anime follows
                the adventures of a kid named Gon who wants to became a pro
                hunter. He sets off to take the entrance exam where thousands
                test but only a select few are able to pass. On his adventure,
                he meets friends who help him on his journey as well as people
                who challenge him to get stronger even as a child. Hunter x
                Hunter is one of the highest rated animes of all time and
                rightly so as almost every single episode and arc has plenty of
                action, character development, and world building. The storyline
                is amazing and it continues to get better the farther into it
                you get. I love the diversity of characters and the power system
                in Hunter x Hunter and this anime contains on of my favorite all
                time anime characters in Killua. This is a longer, but very
                beginner friendly anime and was one of the first anime I ever
                watched when I used to think anime was dumb.

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                Assassination Classroom might be one of the best anime every
                created in terms of character building. This anime is about an
                alien named Koro-sensai who is threating to blow up the rest of
                the moon at the end of one year. He has only one request... to
                teach a bunch of highschoolers who have been cast away as
                nobodies and to make them try to kill him. Not only that, he
                wants to make them the best class by bringing out their full
                potential in their educaiton as well. If you think that sounds
                crazy and intriguing, well it sure is. Not only that this anime
                makes you fall in love with all sorts of colorful characters who
                most would think are irredimable. This anime will put you on a
                roller coaster of emotions and is only a couple seasons long.
                But man does it hit everything that it needs too.

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                Spy x Family is one of my favorite recent animes to come out and
                that is why is lands in the number 8 spot. Another storyline
                that peaks on interests as it follows a spy named Loid who needs
                to get access to a very private and influential man. The only
                problem, he has to get to him through his son who is only about
                six years old and in the most prestigous school in the country.
                Loid adopts a girl named Anya who is actually able to read
                minds, (He does not know this) and have her get close to the
                man's son. He then realizes he needs a wife to make his story
                credible and thats when he meets Yor, who we find out is an
                assassin (he also does not know this) and they become a fake
                husband and wife for their mutual benefit. This anime is a
                perfect slice of life, blended with action and hilarious moments
                the this very disfunctional and yet amazing fake family. This is
                one of my favorite feel good animes ever and am looking forward
                to more of the Forger family.

                Wait!!! "Attack On Titan only number 7... this is the most
                brilliant anime ever created..." Yes, I have heard it all and
                many people will think that I am crazy for putting it at number
                7. Don't get me wrong, I aboslutely love this anime. The
                storyline, the plot twists, and the connection of everything, in
                my opinion will never be topped by anything for years, if ever.
                I think this is the most well-written anime of all time and when
                certain plot twists and reveals were shown... my jaw dropped
                literally. This anime will make you question everything about
                war, segregation, loyalty, and even will you side with a
                homicidal maniac out too destory the world. If people have told
                you anything bad about AoT, they probably don't understand the
                meaning or hated the ending, which I actually enjoyed. There are
                some characters that you wish death upon more than anything else
                in the world. However, this anime is a master piece and I think
                that more anime should follow the blueprints that this has set
                out for us... minus the 15 different parts it took to finish
                season 4.

                Frieren is another anime with only one season to its name so
                far. It follows the adventure of a 1000 year old elven mage
                named Frieren after her and her part defeated the demon king
                decades ago. She finds herself not caring about life and only
                wanting to collect unique and bizarre spells as a hobby. She is
                then asked a favor by an old friend and ends up taking on an
                apprentice who follows her on her journeys. This anime is a bit
                slower paced compared to most fantasy type animes as it explores
                her backstory using various flashbacks as well as small little
                side adventures. She is very mellow and does not really care
                about time, but she starts to realize how precious it truely is
                for the humans she has encountered and become friends with. This
                anime is a perfect blend of action and character building as it
                explores the complex, albeit childish mind of an elven mage who
                all humans could never dream of becoming.

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                Now we get to the really good stuff in the top 5 and starting us
                off we have the famous volleyball anime Haikyuu. This anime
                follows a boy named Shoyo Hinata who wants nothing more than to
                became like his idol The Little Giant and be the ace of
                Karasuno's team. However, he has almost no volleyball game
                experience or technique that is required to play with the best.
                What he brings to the game is sheer speed, athleticism, and his
                insane jumping height. His new setter is a egotistic control
                freak named Kageyama, who wants to control every aspect of the
                game. He thinks Hinata is athletically gifted but refuses to set
                him until he can not be the weak link. These two build a bond
                over the seasons facing adversity from other teams as well as
                themselves as they try to become the best. This anime has some
                of the best sports animation I have seen and almost every single
                game will have you on the edge of your seat. The characters are
                all great and many of them are hilarious in their own way. My
                personal favorite is Bokuto. If you watch the anime, and I
                highly recommend it even if you are not a fan of volleyball, you
                will see why.

                This might be one of my most controversial ones as many people
                have been known too hate on it. However, at number 4, I have
                Fairy Tail. I understand some of the criticism behind it as the
                power of friendship and some fan service are definetly
                noticable. But that does not stop me from aboslutely loving this
                anime and the characters in it. I think this anime has done a
                great job at world building and showing us many different great
                arcs, but the thing I love about this anime the most is all the
                different characters in the Fairy Tail Guild. From the main
                characters Natsu and Lucy, to the wild Gray and Erza, to the
                absolute hilarous Juvia(my absolute favorite) and Gajeel, there
                are no shortage of amazing characters people can relate too. If
                you like darker animes, this one might not be for you, but Fairy
                Tail has some of the most memorable moments in anime and the
                slow build up of characters and their relationships is something
                that kept me going throughout the entirety of the anime.

                One Piece at number 3 might have some people mad at me like my
                previous take on Attack on Titan. However, I currently have it
                at number 3 because I have only made it through about 800
                episodes... yes there are still over 300 more for me to catch up
                on. For the longest time I stayed away from this anime because
                of its length, but man do I regret not watching it sooner. One
                Piece follows the adventures of a young pirate captain named
                Luffy who's life goal is to become king of the pirates and find
                the missing treasure called the One Piece. He forms a crew along
                his many different adventures and you start to really get a feel
                for each and every single member of his crew. The world building
                is absolutely amazing and each character gets their time to
                shine in the spotlight. This anime has made me laugh and cry the
                most out of any anime out there as it is just very silly, but
                nails the darker and more intense moments when it needs to.
                Think of One Piece like a marathon while most animes are a
                sprint or half marathon. It's alot more work but the adventure
                it takes you on is well worth the time. For me this has the
                chance to move up higher and even overtake my number 1 spot.

                Another shock for most people will be Black Clover sitting at
                number 2. Black Clover follows Asta who is a commoner born far
                away on the outskirts of the Clover kingdom. His dream is too
                become the Wizard King, who is the greatest magic user of them
                all. However, Asta was born with 0 magic, an anomoly in this
                world and hopes that maybe he is a late bloomer. Instead he
                trains intensely in his childhood years to build up his body and
                muscle to that 10x the average of a number person. However, he
                is still unable to use magic until one day a mysterious
                grimroire appears and gives him an anti-magic sword. This starts
                off his journey with his best friend/brother Yuno to see who
                will become the wizard king. Black Clover has some pretty
                detailed world building and really great animation and fights,
                but that is not what makes Black Clover special. Much like One
                Piece, you get to learn about every single character in detail
                and see them develop over many episodes. There are many classic
                and cheesy sterotypes, but the anime does a great job of giving
                each character their own unique personality and reaons for why
                they are the way they are. Don't even get me started on the
                amazing character development and storytelling of this anime. It
                does take a little while to get into kinda like One Piece, but
                once you get into it every arc gets better than the previous. If
                you love fantasy, magic, and amazing characters, I highly
                recommend you watch it... oh and its definetly got its darker
                elements to it.

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                The moment everyone has been waiting for! What anime is my
                number 1? My answer might surprise you as Eighty-Six takes my
                number 1 spot. Many of you might not have even heard about this
                anime, many people have never watched it and it is one of the
                most underrated shows in the publics eye. However, every single
                thing that one might want can be found in a 24 episode anime.
                This mecha-anime story follows Vladilina Milize and Shinei
                Nouzen who both work together as handler and fighter. However,
                they have never met or seen one another and for good reason...
                the public believes that the drones that are fighting are
                unmanned. This lie has been going on for almost a decade, but
                there are real humans fighting and dying for them to live
                prosperous lives. Vladilina and Shinei are only linked through
                audio across hundreds of miles with Shinei being the commander
                pilot of one of the drone squads. This anime follows them and
                their "speadhead" squadron who are on the front lines waiting to
                die. This anime has it all -Politics, War Crimes, Action, World
                Building, character development, emotional moments of victory, ,
                happiness, defeat, and death. Every episode is so important to
                the story and tells us so much. I can't say too much more as I
                don't want to spoil anything. If I had to recommend one anime
                that everyone should watch then Eighty-Six would be my answer.
                This anime is about as close to perfect as one could be and it
                caps it off with the two best finale episodes in any anime ever
                in my opinion.
