                version of the game with close to 100 characters from so many
                different properties. This game is a love letter to nintnedo and
                had to make the list in one way or another.

                This game took over my life for about a month. The story of RDR2
                is rich and easily immerses the player into the world of the
                wild west. Although the game has a ton of replay value for the
                story alone, it's not on the top of my list and the multiplayer
                left much to be desired. This is a game I look back on and think
                of dearly.

                Growing up, I wanted to be just like Sly Cooper. I always

                in my mind, but is definetly a product of it's time by current

                Starting off my list at 10, is my most played game in the last
                year. I label myself as a retired gamer, but the game forced me
                out of retirement. The turn-based style of combat similar to old
                flash game I use to play, combined with the dungeon-crawling 2.5
                D elements of the likes of Diablo and the roleplaying potential
                of D&D, created a perfect synergy of just good gameplay and
                storytelling. This is another game that completely took over my
                life for the first 6 months of it's release. The multiplayer
                aspect is seamless and jumoing in the campaign with a party of 4
                brought me back to a level of joy from gaming that hasn't been
                matched in the last 4 years or so.

                Highly regarded from Brock as the best COD of all time, Black
                Ops 2 has three strong game modes in the campaign, multiplayer,
                and zombies to create a perfect boots-on-the-ground shooter
                before jetpacks and special abilities would take over the
                franchise soon after. It's futuristic theme while staying true
                to FPS shooters of old made the perfect mix and is still a game
                I blow the dust of my 360 for and run a couple rounds of zombies
                on Town with my friends. The zombies in particular was at it's
                peak in this game in my opinion. The MSMC absolutely melted
                people.

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                Picture this: It's 2010, you're 10 years old, it's the first
                weekend of summer vacation, you click that silver disc on your
                360 and load up a game, soon after you hear the most beautiful
                song known to man composed completely of hums and only one drum.
                I know you know the song. This is how pretty much every weeekend
                went for me for those next two years. Halo: Reach is buy and
                large the complete Halo game. This may very well be because it
                was my introduction to the series but that is my truth. The
                story of Noble Six and the Spartan III is a story that doesn't
                get enough high regards. THe campaign was awesome and the
                multiplayer was polished. However, the true game was The Forge.
                The ability to create your own custom maps and game modes was
                truly ahead of it's time. I still rememeber me and my clan
                playing custom modes like "Cops and Robbers", "Hot Pursuit",
                "Griff-ball", and "Speed Halo". This game just had endless
                possibilites and was endless fun.

                I damn near worked in GTA V part-time. The grip that this game
                had on me at 15 was insane. I wasn't huge on the story mode but
                I remember it being pretty good, story was not a highlight. But
                GTA Online has to be my most played game ever. The mode was
                packed with microtransactions, pay-to-win mechanics, and was
                such an insane grind. But that never stopped me from clocking in
                and running some missions or jobs to afford that new car that
                Rockstar had dropped that week. The reason that it's so low on
                my list is that this game was, if anything, a social experience.
                PLaying with my friends and meeting new people through the game
                made an experience for me that I can't compare to any game.
                Although, playing GTA Online was pretty much impossible to
                progress with the ssame pace and wasn't nearly as fun. So that
                aspect knocked it down a couple notches.

                I was absolutely cracked at MKX. This is a game I didn't play
                with anyone, becasue any friend that I played would rage quit.
                This is the only game I was natioanlly ranked in and one of the
                few games I took seriously enough to study the metadata and
                remember the amount of frames certain moves take and hitboxes
                and all of the things that make fighting games so in-depth. I
                played with Kenshi and his floating sword; me and Kenshi would
                play ranked for hours to try and rise the leaderboards. Fighting
                games were never on my radar too much, but something about this
                game completely ingulfed me and I find myself booting it up from
                time to time to let off steam. I'm suprised the servers are
                still up and I have no problem finding matches.

                Coming into the top 5, I got Skyrim. Skyrim is the one and only
                game I waited outside of a GameStop for. If I had a number 11,
                Oblivion would have made the list. Bethesda is my favorite
                developer of all time, and while their quality has fell off of a
                cliff, I look back at their older titles as some of the best
                times I've had playing games. Skyrim is the perfect example of a
                fantasy game and is pretty in-depth even by today's standards.
                This game has infinite replay value and with mod support on PC,
                Skyrim can become a completely different game. The story was
                intriguing and gameplay was a refined version of the Bethesda
                formula. While we may never get the Elder Scrolls 6 that we
                deserve, Skyrim does everything I need and more from an RPG.

                This is a personal pick, I don't care. This game has no business
                with the likes of the titles before it, but this game was just
                such a moment in time in my childhood. While GTA was being
                dragged through the mud for being too graphic and violent in the
                media in the early 2000s, by mom would never let me get GTA
                until around GTA IV when I was older. But my mom had no idea
                what Saints Row was. My mom and my aunt bought this game for me
                and cousin and we became the biggest Saints Row fans, probably
                ever. This game was a mix of a gangster drama and a Seth Rogan
                comedy. The story and gameplay was such a wild ride and my
                cousin and I rode that ride until the wheels fell off. Those
                years and time on this game I look back on and I think of him; I
                would do anything to relive those times.

                This game is the best adaption of the Star Wars franchise into
                game format. I was a big Star Wars fan growing up and
                Battlefront 2 had everything I needed and wanted. From the space
                battles, to the king-of-the-hill mode on all of the planets from
                the movies, and to the hero assault mode pitting the Jedi and
                the Sith against each other, this game had it all for a Star
                Wars fan. I have the Classic Collection on PC and is another
                game I hop on from time to time to unwind. Great shooter and
                battle sim.

              <p class="card-text text-white">
                Smash Bros. is a game that will just never get old to me. While
                I find myself playing Ultimate these days, I had to give the nod
                to Brawl as my intro to the series. This game didn't seem
                possible to me when I first heard about it. Brawl had a
                suprisingly good story mode and battling my friends brought
                endless fun. Making custom stages and messing with different
                items and game mods left me on this game for hours. For every
                reason I stated under Ultimate, this game was that and more for
                me. I think I played Meta Knight because he was completely
                unfair, then when we banned him I moved to Link and Falco. Love
                this franchise.

                Yes, I know. The 3 is not a typo. Fallout 3 is greater than New
                Vegas in just about every category. I will say NV may have a
                slight edge story wise, but Fallout 3 had the better map and was
                everything for me in terms of a RPG and shooter. This was the
                qunitessential "hermit game" that had me stuck on the Xbox for
                an entire week. I remember this was the first time I started
                toying with the 360's devkit in order to add mods to the game. I
                almost bricked my 360 more than a few times but it would've been
                a worthy sacrifice for me to add more content to the game I love
                so much. This game and Oblivion were my intro to Bethesda and
                Fallout 3 in particular holds a special place in my heart to
                this day. The post-apocalyptic setting is one that I love and I
                am so deep into the Fallout lore, more than any other property.
